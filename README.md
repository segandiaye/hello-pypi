# hello-pypi

My first [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) package — just testing how [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) works, so the package doesn’t do much, as you can see.

# Install

```bash
pip install hello-pypi-segandiaye
```

# Usage

```bash
from mypackage.hello import hello

print(hello()) # Output : "Hello, PyPI!"
```
